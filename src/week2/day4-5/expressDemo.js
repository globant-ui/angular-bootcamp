// import {router} from "./randomRoute/randomRoute";

const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// First things first, this won't work. It's your job to fix it
// Just a clue, that variable called express is a module, so you need to bring it in.
// If only there was some kind of MANAGER for that ;) (make sure you save it though)

// Once the server is working, add a new route, called "/random" that
// sends out a random number between 0 and 100 as a response.

// ******BONUS POINTS*******
// Add 2 other routes, one that does whatever you want, and another one
// that load up a JSON file from the server (if you don't know what that is, Google it)
// and sends the content as a string (little tip, theres a Js method for that)
